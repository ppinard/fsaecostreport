Make or Buy
===========

.. epigraph::

   *Ok, this is a tricky one.*
   
**From the cost report rules (Article C3.12):**

  Every part on an individual car can be classified as "made" or "bought". 
  This designation does not necessarily refer to whether a team actually 
  purchased or fabricated a part but is a reflection of how the part must be 
  cost from the Cost Tables.
  
  * Made (or manufactured) parts must be cost as if the company manufacturing 
    the vehicle was going to make the part internally. 
    That is by purchasing raw materials and processing them into a finished 
    product.
  * Bought parts must be cost as if the company manufacturing the vehicle 
    was going to outsource the fabrication of that part. 
    These parts would be received by the vehicle manufacturer in a relatively 
    finished state (see the particular table entry comments field for specific 
    information).
    
  The Cost Tables have been constructed as a tradeoff between complexity for 
  the organizers and fairness for the teams. 
  The make versus buy designation enables certain parts to be simplified to a
  relatively few number of entries. 
  For example some teams may purchase axles but the majority of teams 
  manufacture them. 
  Axles are designated "make" parts so teams that purchase axles must cost
  them as if they had made them starting with the raw materials, in this case 
  probably steel tubing.
  Made parts can be distinguished because they do not appear explicitly in 
  the Cost Tables or appear with a "cost as made" option.

Not so clear, the following table might help:

So in short all this means that you may have to create a cost table for a part
that the team purchased, i.e. a fictitious part.
The most ridiculous example is the quick release!
