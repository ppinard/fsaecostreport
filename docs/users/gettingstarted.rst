Where do I start?
=================

The following documents should be read and understood before you start 
doing anything:

* Section C3 in the SAE rules about the cost report
* Go over the Cost Report Tutorial 
  (:download:`cost_report_2009.pdf </attachments/cost_report_2009.pdf>`). 
  The most important slides are 8, 12 and 18.
* Appendix C1 (:download:`appendix_c1.pdf </attachments/appendix_c1.pdf>`). 
  Give more detailed explanations than the slides.
* Appendix C3 (:download:`appendix_c3.pdf </attachments/appendix_c3.pdf>`).
  Name of parts in each system
  
These documents can also be found on the 
`SAE cost report website <http://fsaeonline.com>`_ and on 
`SAE.org <http://sae.org>`_. 
Another somewhat good source of information is the 
`FSAE forum <http://fsae.com>`_. 

After that, continue reading the user section of this documentation.
Refer to the cost report of previous years while keeping in mind that every
year small changes were made to the cost report and cost report generator.
Find an answer to all your questions before you start filling in the cost 
tables.
The worst thing possible is to have to change something when you have already
created 25 parts and assemblies.
