Drawings and pictures
=====================

.. epigraph::

   *The cost report's first two commandments:*
   
     #. *You shall make a technical drawing for every part and assembly.*
     #. *You shall take as many pictures as possible of every finished part.*
   
Technical drawings should be make in *ProE* with the correct drawing template 
(refer to the MRT's Design Standard document) and exported as a PDF.
The scaling of the drawing should be chosen so the final drawing can be
printed on a 8.5" x 11" sheet.
In other words, the scaling of the drawing when printed must be accurate.
The cost report generator is designed to keep the original dimensions of
the drawings.

.. note::

   What about the electrical system?
   Well wiring diagram, dashboard circuitry, etc. are all technical information
   that should be present in the cost report.
   Consider them as "technical drawings".

Pictures should be saved as JPG files.
There is also no point of having a crazy resolution and files of 10 Mb. 
The cost report is printed on a regular printer that doesn't have very high
dpi.
Large pictures only makes the PDF of the final report very big.
Pictures of 1024 x 756 pixels with a resolution of 300 dpi are perfect.
