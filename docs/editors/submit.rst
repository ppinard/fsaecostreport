Submitting the report
=====================

Aesthetic details
-----------------

A few aesthetic details to make a great cost report:

* The binder for the cost report is purchased at the McGill bookstore
* The colour of the binder alternates between black and red. 
  Buy it in advance to make sure they have the right colour.
* The tabs for the different sections should be transparent and we print
  in colour the little piece of paper to identify each system.
  There should be a Microsoft Publisher document on the V drive to use
  as the template.
  If not here are the official RGB colours for the systems::
  
   A=153 204 255
   B=204 255 204
   C=255 153 204
   D=255 204 153
   E=204 153 255
   F=255 153 0
   G=255 255 0
   H=204 255 255
* Put Scotch tape on the end of the tabs to prevent the little piece of paper
  from falling. 
* We usually put the PDF copy of the cost report with the electronic BOM on
  the CD that goes in the report.
* Get a tracking number when you mail it.

Check list
----------

Here is a check list before submitting the report:

* Is there a label on the cost report binder? Does it have the required 
  information (as per SAE rules C3.8.2)?
  
    *The cover of the Cost Report must include the following:
    (a) university name, (b) competition name, and (c) vehicle number.*
    
* Is there tabs for each system?
* Is the electronic BOM on a CD? Is the CD properly labelled (as per SAE
  rules C3.8.1)?

    *Carnumber_schoolname_competitioncode_CR.xls using the assigned car number, 
    the complete school name and the competition code.
    Example: 087_University of FSAE_FSAEM_CR.xls*

* Is there a cover letter? (it's not the introduction!) Is it sign by the
  editors of the cost report and/or the team captains.
* Are all the pages numbered? This includes the drawings. Use the amazing
  automatic page numbering stamp! Careful not to make mistakes.
