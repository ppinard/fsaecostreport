Pictures
========

Pictures are a lot like drawings.
Pictures must be saved in the ``pictures`` folder of their corresponding 
system.
Only JPG pictures are accepted.

If a part or assembly has more than pictures associated to it, use the same
scheme as for the drawings by adding a suffix.
For example, the assembly ``BR-A0001-AA`` has a two pictures.
The first picture (if the order matters) should be ``BR-A0001-AA-00.jpg`` and 
the second one ``BR-A00001-AA-01.jpg``.

As mentioned in the user's documentation, there is no point of having ultra
high resolution pictures.
Always reduce the size to about 1024 x 756 pixels.
You don't want the final cost report to be 100 Mb in size.
