Hi all,

As per recommendation from SAE, we will be using last year's system for the cost report (excel spreadsheets). So you can forget everything about the cost report application.

If you are new to the cost report,
I recommend the following readings before you start doing anything:

   1. Section C3 in the SAE rules about the cost report (starts on p.66)
   2. Go over the Cost Report Tutorial (Cost_Tutorial_2009.pdf). The most important slides are 8, 12 and 18.
   3. Appendix C1 (Appendix_C1.pdf). Give more detailed explanations than the slides.
   4. Appendix C3 (Appendix_C3.pdf). Name of parts in each system

If you did the cost report last year,
a few reminders

   1. I included last year's processes in each subteam's zip file as well as this year BOM.
   2. The materials, processes, fasteners, toolings, process multiplers tables are in the 2010 BOM xlsx file.
   3. Refer to the part diagram (part_diagram.pdf) for the correct part number
   4. Copy the TM-A0001-AA (Assembly) and TM-00001-AA (Part) sheet for every new part or assembly
   5. Many columns are automatically filled when you enter the ID (first column)
   6. You should never have to erase a formula. The only exception is for the unit cost that are made of an equation which you should replace with the correct formula.
   7. For raw material, there is no more cross section, length and density. Simply enter the dimensions in the column Use and enter the mass of the part in column Unit1.
   8. You don't have to fill out the BOM sheet.
   9. For every part and assembly,
         1. Technical drawing in pdf
         2. Pictures if you can

If you have any questions, or you find a bug, email me.

We can discuss the due date during the meeting tomorrow, but I would say that you should send me everything by March 26 at the latest.

Cheers,
Phil
